PROG8245 - Machine Learning Programming 
Lab3 - Data Engineering & EDA with Python, SQL, and Pandas

Name:Haysam Elamin
ID: 8953681

The goal of this project is to:
- Connect to a cloud-based SQL database.
- Use Python and Pandas to collect, clean, transform, and scale real-world data.
- Perform exploratory data analysis (EDA) to understand data patterns.
- Create and interpret meaningful visualizations to communicate insights.

Approach:

- Data Access: Connect to a Neon.tech SQL database to retrieve synthetically generated data. 
- Create a DataFrame and load the data from the database into it for further analysis.
- Data Preparation: Use Python and Pandas to clean the data, apply necessary transformations, and scale it to ensure consistency and readiness for analysis.
- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Perform EDA to explore the dataset, uncover patterns, detect trends, and identify any anomalies.
- Visualization: Develop clear and insightful visualizations to effectively present key findings and support data-driven conclusions.
